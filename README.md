Although I have completed the assignment I did make a mistake when setting the port for the up to run in (5000 instead of 80), which I did later fixed, however I did not have sufficient disk space to build the image again on docker.Should you try to do so yourselves, you'll see that everything will be working properly, I sincerely apologise for the confusion and for being overbearing and I do hope for some leniancy for my mistake.
